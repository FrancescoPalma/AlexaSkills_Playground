1) **Gentleman**: A custom HelloWorld Alexa Skill :) Gentleman's purpose is to greet the user with politeness. Once enabled the skill, the user can launch the skill with an Echo device by saying, '**Alexa, Hello!**' or '**Alexa, Hey!**' and Gentleman will reply with a proper greeting based on the current local time of the user. For example, if it's morning time the first sentence will be, '**Good Morning! ...**'
